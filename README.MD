## XSL-FO:

- https://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/
- COMMAND: `./fop inputs/hello.xml inputs/hello.pdf`

#### fo:root:

The root element of all XSL-FO documents is fo:root. This element normally declares the fo prefix, which **must be** mapped to the http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Format namespace URI. As always, the prefix can change as long as the URI stays the same.
